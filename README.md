Crawler to predict the availability of a full text at a given URL

Goal
----

[Bielefeld Academic Search Engine](https://www.base-search.net/) covers almost 100 million metadata records harvested
from open repositories. The problem is that for most of them, we have no idea whether they link to a full text or not.
For instance, [this item](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/529311) does not seem to be associated with a
freely downloadable full text, whereas [this one](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1742/) is.

The goal of this software is to perform this classification (not necessarily archiving the full texts when they are available,
just classifying the URLs into open / closed).
